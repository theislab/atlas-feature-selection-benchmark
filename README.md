# Atlas feature selection benchmarking

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13995812.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13995812)

This repository contains code for benchmarking the effect of feature selection on scRNA-seq atlas construction and use.

For more information please refer to the documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/theislab/atlas-feature-selection-benchmark/wiki).

## Directory structure

* `analysis/` - Notebooks used to perform analysis of the results

## Data files

Data files for this project are available from [figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Benchmarking_feature_selection_for_scRNA-seq_integration/214819).
The analysis reports in the `analysis/` directory assume:

* [Metric files](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Metric_scores/26390911) are downloaded to the `data/` directory
* [Selected features files](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Selected_features/26390944) are downloaded to the `data/selected-features/` directory
